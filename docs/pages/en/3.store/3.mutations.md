description: 'Vanilla, strongly-typed store accessor.'

Mutations are functions that receive store state and an optional payload.

This package provides a helper function to reduce boilerplate: `mutationTree`. This function adds typings and returns the mutations passed to it, without transforming them.

::::code-block{label="Helper function" active}

```ts
import { mutationTree } from 'typed-vuex'

export const mutations = mutationTree(state, {
  setEmail(state, newValue: string) {
    state.email = newValue
  },

  initialiseStore() {
    console.log('initialised')
  },
})
```

::::
::::code-block{label="Vanilla"}

```ts
export const mutations = {
  setEmail(state: RootState, newValue: string) {
    state.email = newValue
  },

  initialiseStore() {
    console.log('initialised')
  },
}
```

1. Even if you do not use the `mutationTree` helper function, make sure not to use the `MutationTree` type provided by Vuex. This will interfere with type inference. You won't lose out by omitting it, as Typescript will complain if you pass an improperly formed mutation into [the `getAccessorType` function](/getting-started-nuxt#add-type-definitions).

2. This package does not support [object-style commits](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html#object-style-commit).
